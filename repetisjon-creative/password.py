# create a prompt where the user is asked to create an account with a username
# and a password



# the password should be between 8 and 16 in length
# and must contain a number, a lowercase letter and an uppercase letter



# we must now require an email instead of a username for the login.
# the email must have a '@', and end in '.no', '.com' or '.org'
