# create a prompt where the user is asked to create an account with a username
# and a password



# the password should be between 8 and 16 in length
# and must contain a number, a lowercase letter and an uppercase letter



# we must now require an email instead of a username for the login, but 
# keep the option of the username 
# the email must have a '@', and end in '.no', '.com' or '.org'
# still ask the user


# the user should be asked to put their first and last-name, and the program 
# should then use their first-name in all subsequent prompts


# put the code into nice functions


# we must store the password hashed - use the hashlib-module!



# next up we are going to store the information in a binary-file
